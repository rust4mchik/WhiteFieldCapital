                  <h4>White Field Capital Established</h4>
                  <p class="normal">White Field Capital was founded in 2010 by Mark Sawyer and Brandon Smith in Boise,
                    Idaho, focusing primarily on early stage small businesses. The initial fund has since seen a full
                    exit
                    of the 2010 vintage fund with net ROIC of 2.69x and net IRR of 26.4%.</p>

                <div class="col-lg-9 col-md-9">
                  <h4>Relocated to Puerto Rico</h4>
                  <p class="normal">Upon the formation and onset of our second fund, White Field Capital relocated its
                    headquarters to Puerto Rico under Act 20 and the second fund was raised and deployed, focusing on
                    leveraged buy outs within product and aviation businesses.</p>

                    locations in Denver, Colorado and Charlotte, North Carolina. The aggregate net IRR returns thus far
                    have been 31.8%* to our investors as of this writing.</p>

              <h4>Financial Services</h4>
              <p class="normal">As most business owners know, a businesses’ finances are often one of the most important
                metrics to monitor and control to ensure the success of a business. Unfortunately, however, most
                business owners do not have the training, time, or experience to properly plan and manage the financial
                aspects of their business. We can help. Our team has an extensive financial background to offer support
                with financial forecasting, budget creation, valuations, accounting, and book keeping. We work with
                management to create systems, budgets, models, and financial discipline techniques to help a business
                thrive!</p>

              <h4>Project Management</h4>
              <p class="normal">Project management is more than just getting the job done. True project management
                requires clear, definable objectives to be set, a thorough timeline created, strict adherence to a
                budget, quality control checks, and consistent follow up. Managing multiple projects is something that
                many businesses struggle with. By implementing and enforcing the use of a few simple tools and
                practices, we can help add project management discipline to a business. The results often lead to
                increased employee and client satisfaction, improved budget awareness, and overall improvement in
                efficiency.</p>

              <h4>Strategic Planning</h4>
              <p class="normal">You have to know where you want to be before you can get there, so creating a detailed
                plan of attack only makes sense to do from beginning. We implement the plan that shows where
                improvements need to be made for the future. We work with management and industry experts to identify
                opportunities, goals, and potential obstacles for their business for a defined period of time. This plan
                incorporates detailed financial plans, marketing strategies and analysis, operational implementations,
                and more. A clear plan makes sure everyone is marching to the same beat!</p>

              <h4>Talent Management</h4>
              <p class="normal">A plan is only as good as it’s execution, which is why it’s important to find, manage,
                and retain the right talent for the job. It’s not always easy to know who to hire, when, and how much to
                compensate them. It’s even harder to consistently train, coach, and offer feedback to your staff in a
                meaningful way. We use a few basic principles and techniques to help find the best person, or team, for
                a position. Playing to your staff’s strengths and giving them clear guidance will lead to a happier
                office, greater productivity, and increased creative thinking. We have a passion for coaching and
                leading others!</p>

              <h4>Mergers & Buyouts</h4>
              <p class="normal">Sometimes the best way to grow is to simply buy out your buddy or combine forces with
                them. Doing so can be a very powerful option in some cases, but can also be a gaping pitfall if not
                executed properly. The process is not easy and often can be intimidating to an entrepreneur with little
                prior experience in this area. We can help get the conversation started, negotiate terms, conduct in
                depth diligence, and manage the transaction to help ensure a successful acquisition.</p>

              <p class="normal">White Field Capital can add meaningful value through marketing for just about any
                business, regardless of whether they are a product or service provider, online-based or working out of
                brick and mortar location. Pay per click, search engine optimization, video marketing, website design,
                graphic design, and conversion tuning can all help a business increase leads, conversions, and brand
                recognition. Each business we work with receives an in-depth marketing analysis as one of our first
                steps.</p>
